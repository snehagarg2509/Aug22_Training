int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);


flags:

O_RDONLY: Open the file for reading only.
O_WRONLY: Open the file for writing only.
O_RDWR: Open the file for both reading and writing.
O_CREAT: Create the file if it does not exist. Requires a third argument mode to specify the permissions.
O_TRUNC: Truncate the file to zero length if it already exists and is opened for writing.
O_APPEND: Writes are appended to the end of the file.


mode (optional):

Specifies the file permissions if the file is created (i.e., if O_CREAT is used). This is specified in octal and is passed as the third argument.
Common permission values:
S_IRUSR: User has read permission.
S_IWUSR: User has write permission.
S_IRGRP: Group has read permission.
S_IROTH: Others have read permission.
