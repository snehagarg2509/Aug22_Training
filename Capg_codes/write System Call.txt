write System Call
The write system call is used to write data from a buffer to a file descriptor.

#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);


Parameters
fd: The file descriptor where data will be written. This can be the result of an open call (e.g., a file), or it can be STDOUT_FILENO for standard output.

buf: A pointer to the buffer that contains the data to be written.

count: The number of bytes to write.
