index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	8		3		7		1		9		5		2
			left												right
			loc
step1 compare right ele with pivot (2 with 8 as  2 is smaller than 8 ie. right element is smaller than pivot, exchange and set the loc to point the pivot element)

index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		9		5		8
			left												right
															loc
step2 compare left ele with pivot (2 with 8 as  2 is smaller than 8 ie. left element is smaller than pivot, no exchange move left pointer forward)

index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		9		5		8
					left										right
															loc
same happens in case of 3, 7, 1 I.,e step 3,4,5
index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		9		5		8
											left				right
															loc 
Now in step 6 compare left ele with pivot (9 with 8 as 9 is larger than 8 ie. left element is larger than pivot, exchange and set the loc to point to the pivot element)
index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		8		5		9
											left				right
											loc 
step7 compare right ele with pivot(9 with 8 9 is larger i.e right element is larger than pivot, no exchang move the right pointer backward)
index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		8		5		9
											left		right
											loc 
step8 : compare right ele with pivot(5 with 8 5 is smaller i.e right element is smaller than pivot, exchang move the loc to point to the pivot element)
index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		5		8		9
											left		right
													loc 
step9: compare left ele with pivot (5 with 8 as  5 is smaller than 8 ie. left element is smaller than pivot, no exchange move left pointer forward)
index  		0		1		2		3		4		5		6
Elements	2		3		7		1		5		8		9
													left		
													right
													loc 
 cant continue because left == loc so return loc ,, which is the correct loction of pivot. if you observe now all elements towards left are smaller than  8 and towards right are greater than 8.
