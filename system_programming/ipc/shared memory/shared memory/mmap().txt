Purpose: Maps the shared memory object into the process's address space.


void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);



Parameters:
addr: Starting address for mapping (usually NULL for auto-selection).
length: Size of the memory region to map.
prot: Memory protection options (e.g., PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE).
flags: Mapping options (e.g., MAP_SHARED to share changes with other processes).
fd: File descriptor of the shared memory object.
offset: Offset from which to start the mapping (usually 0).


Return Value: Returns a pointer to the mapped region or MAP_FAILED on error.
